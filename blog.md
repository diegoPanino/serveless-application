## About Me
I've done the IT school, a long time ago, and then for the cases of life, I completely switch my 'career', leaving coding only as a hobby.
In the last 3 years, I decided to switch back to my origin, so I started the journey to upgrade my knowledge, learning how to write good code and make this my daily routine, working online and roaming around the globe!
